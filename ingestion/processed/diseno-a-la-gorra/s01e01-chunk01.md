# Diseño a la Gorra (2020) — S01E01 — Chunk 01 (00:00–10:00)

## Summary (high-signal)
- Hernán Wilkinson and Máximo open the series and set expectations for an interactive, practical webinar.
- Core theme: software design with objects, taught through concrete coding examples.
- They explicitly emphasize **learning by doing**, not just theory.
- Multi-language examples are planned to compare design decisions across ecosystems.
- Topic map includes: modeling, encapsulation, polymorphism, exceptions, TDD, refactoring, legacy maintenance, and history.
- Audience is invited to steer topics with real design problems and questions.
- "A la gorra" model is explained as voluntary contribution to sustain the series.

## Heuristics detected
- Prefer practical examples over abstract exposition.
- Keep sessions conversational and interruptible to maximize learning value.
- Use cross-language comparison to reveal design invariants.
- History/context matters to understand why design practices exist.

## Ruby/TDD applicability
- Reinforces test-driven, example-first teaching style that maps well to Ruby teams.
- Suggests we should preserve language-agnostic design principles, then encode them idiomatically in Ruby.
- Good fit for our KB approach: principle -> small example -> tradeoff.

## Open questions for discussion
- Which design heuristics are claimed to be language-independent vs Ruby-specific?
- How do they balance conceptual purity vs delivery constraints in real projects?
- Where do they draw boundaries between OO style and functional style in practice?
