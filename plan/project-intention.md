# Project Intention — ruby-oop-tdd-kb

## Why this exists
We want a shared, durable knowledge base so we can do solid OOP/TDD development as a team, with consistent design language and better technical decisions.

## What success looks like
- During feature work and code review, we can quickly retrieve relevant heuristics and examples.
- Team discussions converge faster because principles/tradeoffs are documented.
- New insights from courses/projects are distilled into reusable notes instead of being lost.

## Non-goals
- Storing full transcripts as the final output.
- Writing long theory essays without direct Ruby/TDD applicability.

## Pipeline
1. Collect raw transcripts in `ingestion/raw/`.
2. Distill into concise notes using `templates/note-template.md`.
3. Review and refine notes through PR discussion.
4. Keep INDEX and links updated for retrieval.
